In this problem, I found that it is a project that is constantly doing conditional testing, and there will be cases 
of conformity and non-conformity after each entry into the conditional test. As long as the conformity occurs, the 
constantly changing and updated content will be put into the condition Check until the condition is non-conformity, 
then leave this control flow. Based on the above, I mainly use the loop collocation to judge whether it is correct 
or not to solve the problem.

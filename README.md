>In this problem, I found that it is a project that is constantly doing conditional testing, and there will be cases of conformity and non-conformity after each entry into the conditional test. As long as the conformity occurs, the constantly changing and updated content will be put into the condition Check until the condition is non-conformity, then leave this control flow. Based on the above, I mainly use the loop collocation to judge whether it is correct or not to solve the problem.

 - Start the program
 - At the beginning, set an initial value variable 0 into x.
 - Put in the condition of x*x<36 to check whether it is true.
 - If it is true, the x value will be increased by 1 to become x=1, put in the condition and continue to check.
 - If the condition of x*x<36 continues to hold true, x will continue to be incremented by 1 and put into view. 
 - Until the conditions are not met (here, the case of x*xâ‰¥36), the value of x is printed out directly.
 - End the program.

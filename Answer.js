Put in the condition of x*x<36 to check whether it is true.
If it is true, the x value will be increased by 1 to become x=1, put in the condition and continue to check.
If the condition of x*x<36 continues to hold true, x will continue to be incremented by 1 and put into view. 
Until the conditions are not met (here, the case of x*xâ‰¥36), the value of x is printed out directly.
